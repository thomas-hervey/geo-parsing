  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2015-03-18</h2><p><span class="loc">Leicester</span> prepares for <span class="per">Richard III</span> reburial</p><p><span class="loc">Dadlington</span> usually divides its sympathies between the two sides, but for this they are coming out in favour of the deposed king in the Battle of <span class="loc">Bosworth Field</span></p><p><span class="loc">Leicester</span> is filling up with yellow road signs, warning of the return of the once and future king: "<span class="per">King Richard III</span> Route <span class="date">Sunday</span> 22 – expect delays".</p><p>Many have been wondering how to get hold of them to keep as
souvenirs of an extraordinary episode in the history of the city and county, as the final preparations get underway for the 21st century reburial of a medieval king.</p><p>It is <span class="date">more than two years</span> since the bones rediscovered by archaeologists under a council car park in the heart of <span class="loc">Leicester</span>, were formally identified as those of the last Plantagenet king.</p><p>In <span class="date">1485</span> the burial by Franciscan friars was unceremonious. In the heat of <span class="date">August</span>, <span class="date">several days</span> after his death at <span class="loc">Bosworth</span>, he was buried hastily in a roughly-dug grave slightly too small for his naked body. This time <span class="date">a week</span> of events will surround the reinterment on <span class="date">Thursday</span> 26 in the cathedral – delayed for <span class="date">a year</span> by a legal challenge claiming that he should have been buried in <span class="loc">York</span> – including a procession on <span class="date">Sunday</span> through the countryside associated with the last <span class="date">days</span> of the last Plantagenet, led by two knights in armour on horseback.</p><p>There will be prayers in the cathedral from two archbishops, <span class="per">Justin Welby</span> and <span class="per">Vincent Nichols</span>; open-air religious services; live television broadcasts to an audience of millions; lectures, art exhibitions and book launches; flower festivals; concerts of medieval music; fireworks and the first ringing of a new peal of bells composed for <span class="per">Richard</span>.</p><p>In the cathedral the £2.5m remodelling outside and in is almost complete. Beautiful red sandstone slabs, inset with four small white stone roses, have been laid in the new space created behind the altar, where purple drapes <span class="date">now</span> cover a brick-lined pit ready to receive the coffin. The work disturbed seven previously unrecorded burial vaults, and their dozens of occupants have been reverently gathered up and reburied. The tomb of the <span class="loc">Vaughns</span>, a 19th-century vicar and his family, which began to peel off the wall from the vibrations from the work, has been boxed in for safety and will be restored later.</p><p>"We're almost there," the <span class="per">Rev Pete Hobson</span> said. "The new altar is due to arrive with just two or <span class="date">three days</span> to spare – when it comes I'll breath more easily."</p><p>People are coming from all over the world not just for the cathedral, where every seat could have been filled a hundred times, but to myriad events in the small villages and towns usually bypassed by tourists: they include a Last Plantagenet Dinner at the <span class="loc">Red Lion</span> in <span class="loc">Market Bosworth</span>, where school children have made half a mile of bunting and the medieval costumes have arrived for all the staff of Chocol8s sweet shop selling shields ornamented with white chocolate roses.</p><p>In the village of <span class="loc">Sutton Cheney</span> representatives of the local council, the highways authority, the cathedral, villagers, the vicar and churchwardens, gathered to measure with a stop watch every second of the ten minutes the cortege will stop on <span class="date">Sunday afternoon</span> on its slow way to the cathedral. It won't allow enough time to come into the church of <span class="loc">St James</span> the Greater, where <span class="per">Richard</span> is believed to have taken his last communion before the battle, so <span class="per">Julia Hargreaves</span> will hold a prayer service at the gate. Clerk <span class="per">Shelley Howard</span> arrived a little late, having taken a phone call from somebody in <span class="loc">Ohio</span> asking if they could come to the previous night's candlelit service. "They wanted to know how much the tickets were," she said, shaking her head in amazement.</p><p>A country lane leads from the village street to <span class="loc">Ambion Hill</span>, where <span class="per">Richard</span>'s troops are believed to have camped on the eve of battle, <span class="date">now</span> the site of the <span class="org">Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre</span> where a major open air ceremony will be led by the <span class="per">Tim Stevens</span>, the bishop of <span class="loc">Leicester</span>. When tickets went online <span class="date">10 days ago</span>, the website crashed within minutes: every member of staff came in to deal by phone with thousands of enquiries.</p><p><span class="per">Richard Mackinder</span>, operations manager at the centre, is slightly worried about the impact of the event on passionate Ricardians: "When the dead body of a medieval king – the real remains of a man some of these people have idolised for much of their lives – passes within a few yards, I think it's going to be an unimaginable experience. We have to prepare for every eventuality."</p><p>The churchyard at <span class="loc">Dadlington</span> gives a panoramic view of the entire battle landscape, from <span class="loc">Ambion Hill</span> to the marshy corner of a field at Fen Lane, several miles away, where <span class="per">Richard</span> lost his horse in a last desperate charging attempt to kill <span class="date">the future</span> <span class="per">Henry VII</span>, lost his crown and his helmet, and then lost his life to two savage blows to the base of his skull.</p><p>The village was so close to the fighting that some accounts called it the battle of <span class="loc">Dadlington</span>, and a small blue sign in the graveyard records that the bodies of hundreds who fell on both sides were buried there. On at least three occasions in <span class="date">the last two centuries</span>, most recently in <span class="date">the 1950s</span>, pits of bones were found as graves were being dug for village funerals.</p><p>After the cortege passes through, the tiny village has organised <span class="date">an entire day</span> of events, centred on the village green and hall – which they decided <span class="date">last month</span> was looking unacceptably shabby and within a fortnight, using local volunteers and donated materials, completely redecorated inside and out.</p><p><span class="loc">Dadlington</span> usually divides its sympathies between the two sides, but the villagers have already packed the church on a <span class="date">Saturday night</span>, put <span class="per">Richard</span> on trial for the murder of his nephews, the Little Princes in the Tower, and found him not guilty: "you may leave without a stain on your character," <span class="per">Jacqui Morton</span>, a former banker acting as judge for the night, assured him.</p><p>The battlefield centre usually flies the standards of both <span class="per">Richard</span> and <span class="per">Henry</span> Tudor – "without wanting to appear like the Stanleys", <span class="per">Mackinder</span> said, of <span class="per">Richard</span>'s former ally who lurked on the fringes of the battle until he saw which way the wind was blowing and then threw in his forces with the Tudors, "we usually have to sit on the fence a bit" – but on <span class="date">Sunday</span> will only fly <span class="per">Richard</span>'s.</p><p>At <span class="loc">Sutton Cheney</span>, on the anniversary of the battle every <span class="date">August</span>, churchwarden <span class="per">Mary Burgess</span> includes a little red posy with the white flowers she lays for <span class="per">Richard</span>, to remember the dead of both sides. "But on <span class="date">Sunday</span> we'll have white flowers only," she said. "This is the day for <span class="per">Richard</span>."</p><br><br>
