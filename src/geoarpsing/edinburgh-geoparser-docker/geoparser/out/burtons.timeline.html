  <div id="text"><h2>Docdate: 2016-02-24</h2><p>How the home of Mini Rolls and Smash was gobbled up</p><p>Food factory workers facing the the sack will march on <span class="date">Saturday</span> for an
economy that values more than just money</p><p>Among the thousands of people who join the big anti-cuts march <span class="date">this
Saturday</span> will be a coach load from <span class="loc">Wirral</span>. Though where they live has
been suffering from the public-sector axe since <span class="date">2009</span>, their cause is
less about austerity than a story that extends from the looming
closure of a 60-year old biscuit factory into the byzantine workings
of the modern business. Given that the demonstration – organised by
the <span class="org">TUC</span> – is titled the "<span class="date">March</span> for the alternative", they surely have
something crucial to contribute: an argument not just against cuts,
but the kind of flimsy, imbalanced economy that makes millions of
people even more vulnerable to them.</p><p>The <span class="org">Burton's Foods</span> factory has been in the pinched suburb of <span class="loc">Moreton</span>
since <span class="date">1953</span>. For <span class="date">the first 30 years</span> of its life, with a workforce
peaking at nearly 5,000, the factory was part of the confectionery
empire run by <span class="org">Cadbury</span>'s, with an enlightened labour relations model
and an array of fondly loved brands that tumbled from its production
lines: Mini Rolls, Chocolate Fingers, Smash instant mash.</p><p>But in <span class="date">1986</span>, there was a management buyout, and its troubled second
act began. Since then, the company that renamed itself <span class="org">Burton's Foods</span>
has switched owners at least five times, and a recent private equity
buyout saddled the firm with very serious debts. <span class="date">Now</span> the biggest
shareholders are the <span class="org">Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</span>, and a
multinational finance outfit called <span class="org">Apollo Global Management</span>. Burton's
biscuit production turns a profit, and life for its board seems very
nice indeed. <span class="date">Last year</span>, directors' pay rose by an average of 97.5%,
and the most handsome package went up by 119.9%.</p><p>There are no such glad tidings in <span class="loc">Moreton</span>. After serially cutting
production here, the company <span class="date">now</span> plans to close the factory with the
loss of 342 jobs.  Worse still, <span class="loc">Wirral borough</span> council is set on
shedding more than a thousand people – a sixth of its payroll – by the
<span class="date">summer</span>, and for every local job vacancy there are currently 17
applicants. When <span class="per">George Osborne</span> delivers <span class="date">Wednesday</span>'s budget, he will
doubtless point to supposed sunlit uplands of recovery, and perhaps
underline his belief that, as he hacks back the public sector, private
firms will fill the gap. Not here.</p><p>I came to <span class="loc">Wirral</span> after we appealed on Comment is free for word from
the frontline of British trade unionism.  On the thread that followed,
hostile voices ("unions need to be crushed") took issue with more
supportive contributors ("people have a fundamental right to
collectively improve their lot"), and a few people mentioned the
dreamy idea of European-style social partnership, whereby British
labour relations might lose their traditionally adversarial charge.</p><p>In <span class="loc">Moreton</span>, on the union's side at least, that has happened. For four
of <span class="date">the last 10 years</span> the workforce has agreed to a pay freeze. Since
<span class="date">2001</span> they have delivered £12.7m of cost savings, while the success of
the lines they produce has often skyrocketed. In <span class="date">2007</span>, when closure
was first suggested and the Unite union led a successful campaign –
without a strike – to save the factory, at the cost of 500 jobs, the
firm promised to turn one production line into "a centre of
excellence", and not to attempt any more big changes before <span class="date">May
2012</span>. To quote the local MP, the shadow Treasury minister <span class="per">Angela
Eagle</span>: "None of the workforce could have done any better – and what is
their reward?  The sack."</p><p>Listening to people who fear being left at the mercy of a non-existent
job market, I was struck by one thought: as far as mainstream politics
is concerned, talking about the root of this place's predicament is
clearly off limits. Yet ideas are out there: Unite talks about working
at an <span class="org">EU</span> level to give deals struck with employees legal force, so the
shadowy financial interests that control increasing parts of the
economy cannot always devastate communities on a whim. More generally,
there is the kind of enlightened business approach urged <span class="date">last weekend</span>
by Andrew Witty, the chief executive of <span class="org">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, who
bemoaned not only corporate tax avoidance, but the entire economic
culture in which bottom lines are relentlessly pushed downwards, and
the social costs are always someone else's concern.</p><p>Witty summed up the great misstep of business over <span class="date">the last 20 years</span>:
"They've allowed it to be perceived that it's all about money. It
shouldn't be about that … We want to make a return, yes – we're not a
charity. We want to make a good return for our shareholders. But we're
going to do it by being in step with society."</p><p>Somewhere in those words, even if he himself may not know it, there is
not just a pithy diagnosis of what has gone wrong, but a tantalising
hint of how things could be different. Not the standard free-market
cartoon of a world returned to <span class="date">the 1970s</span>, but corporate social
responsibility pushed beyond the odd bit of charity, and politicians
on the left realising that if they think seriously – and
internationally – about all this, some business people might not be
quite as hostile as they think.</p><p>To echo the title of the big march, there is an alternative. But on <span class="date">a
grey day</span> in <span class="loc">Moreton</span>, it seems light <span class="date">years</span> away: distant, theoretical,
and no compensation for the blows to come.</p><br><br>
