</p><p>tis towards the north. Here they fixed them-
selves, and <span class="date">now</span> remain. The women of the
Sauromata: still retain their former habits of
life; they pursue the chace on horseback, some-
times with and sometimes without their bus-
bands, and, dressed in the habits of the men,
frequently engage in battle.
</p><p>CXVII. The Sauromatce use the Scythian
language, but their dialect has always been im-
pure, because the Amazons themselves had
learned it but imperfectly. With respect to
their institutions concerning marriage, no vir-
gin is permitted to marry till she first have
killed an enemy." It sometimes therefore
happens that many women die single at an
advanced age, having never been able to fulfil
the conditions required.
</p><p>CXVII I. To these nations, which I have
described, assembled in council, the Scythian
ambassadors were admitted;   they informed
the princes, that the Persian, baring reduced
under bis authority all the nations of the ad-
joining continent, had thrown a bridge over the
neck of the <span class="loc">Bosphorus</span>, in order to pass into
theirs: that he had already subdued <span class="loc">Thrace</span>,
and constructed a bridge over the <span class="loc">Ister</span>, am-
bitiously hoping to reduce them also. "Will
it be just," they continued, "for you to remain
inactive spectators of our ruin? Rather, having
the same sentiments, let us advance together
against this invader: unless you do this, we
shall be reduced to the last extremities, and be
compelled either to forsake our country, or to
submit to the terms he may impose. If you
withhold your assistance, what may we not
dread? Neither will you have reason to expect
a different or a better fate: for are not you the
object of the Persian's ambition as well as our-
selves? or do you suppose that, having van-
quished us, he will leave you unmolested?
That wc reason justly, you have sufficient evi-
dence before you. If his hostilities were di-
rected only against us, with the view of re-
venging upon us the former servile condition
of his nation, he would immediately have
inarched into our country, without at all injur-
ing or molesting others; he would have shown
</p><p>2 Killed an enemy.'}   The account which <span class="per">Hippocrates</span>
gives is somewhat different: the women of the Sauromaue
mount on horseback, draw the bow, lance the Javelin
from on horseback, and go to war as long as they remain
unmarried: they are not suffered to marry till they have
killed three enemies ; nor do they cohabit with their hus-
bands till they have performed the ceremonies which
their laws require. Their married women do not go on
horseback, unless indeed it should be necessary to make
a national expedition.
</p><p>by his conduct, that his indignation was directed
against the Scythians only. On the contrary,
as soon as ever he set foot upon our continent,
he reduced all the nations which he met, and
has subdued the Thracians, and our neighbours
the Getse."
</p><p>CXIX. When the Scythians had thus de-
livered their sentiments, the princes of the
nations who were assembled, deliberated among
themselves, but great difference of opinion pre-
vailed; the sovereigns of the <span class="per">Geloni</span>, <span class="per">Budini</span>,
and Sauromata; were unanimous in their in-
clination to assist the Scythians; but those of
the <span class="loc">Agathyrsi</span>, Neuri, Androphagi, Melan-
chheni, and Tauri, made this answer to the
ambassadors: "If you had not been the first
aggressors in this dispute, having first of all
commenced hostilities against <span class="loc">Persia</span>, your de-
sire of assistance would have appeared to us
reasonable; we should have listened to you
with attention, and yielded the aid which you
require: but without any interference on our
part, you first made incursions into their ter-
ritories, and as long as fortune favoured you,
ruled over <span class="loc">Persia</span>. The same fortune <span class="date">now</span>
seems propitious to them, and they only retali-
ate your own conduct upon you. We did not
before offer any injury to this people, neither
without provocation shall we do so <span class="date">now</span>: but
if he attack our country, and commence hos-
tilities against us, he will find that we shall
not patiently endure the insult. Until he shall
do this we shall remain neutral. We cannot
believe that the Persians intend any injury to
us, but to those alone who first offended them."
</p><p>CXX. When the Scythians heard this, and
found that they had no assistance to expect,
they determined to avoid all open and decisive
encounters: with this view they divided them-
selves into two bodies, and retiring gradually
before the enemy, they filled up the wells and
fountains which lay in their way, and destroyed
the produce of their fields. The Sauromata.'
were directed to advance to the district under
the authority of <span class="per">Scopasis</span>, with orders, upon
the advance of the Persians, to retreat towards
the <span class="loc">Maeotis</span>, by the river <span class="loc">Tanais</span>. If the Per-
sians retreated, they were to harass and pursue
them. This was the disposition of one part
of their power. The two other divisions
of their country, the greater one under Imlu-
thyreus, and the third under Taxacis, were to
join themselves to the <span class="per">Geloni</span> and <span class="per">Budini</span>, and
advancing a day's march before the Persians,
were gradually to retreat, and in other respects
