<p>Nadal and Murray set up semi showdown
(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray are both through to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup in <span class="loc">Toronto</span>, where they will face each other for a place in Sunday's final.
Murray played some superb tennis in crushing the in-form David Nalbandian but Nadal had to recover from dropping the opening set to get past <span class="loc">Germany</span>'s Philipp Kohlschreiber.
Nalbandian won the ATP title in <span class="loc">Washington</span> last weekend and came into Friday's encounter on an 11-match unbeaten streak.
But the fourth-seeded Briton, who has struggled to find his top form this season, brushed aside the Argentine in impressive fashion, securing a 6-2 6-2 victory in just 69 minutes.
"It was probably one of the best matches I've played this year," Murray told the official ATP Tour website.
"I served well and got the first good hits in a lot of the rallies, so I was able to dictate a lot of the points," added Murray -- who is the defending champion after winning the tournament in <span class="loc">Montreal</span> last year.
Meanwhile, top seed Nadal also secured his place in the last four, but he was not as impressive as Murray in a 3-6 6-3 6-4 victory over Kohlschreiber
In the evening session, third seed Federer will face a <span class="loc">Wimbledon</span> re-match with Czech Tomas Berdych, who beat him in the quarterfinals of the grasscourt tournament.
The winner of that match will face either second seed Novak Djokovic or Jeremy Chardy of <span class="loc">France</span> for a place in the final.</p>
