  <event start="0000-00-00T00:00:00Z" title="the future Henry VII, lost">
    The churchyard at Dadlington gives a panoramic view of the entire battle landscape, from Ambion Hill to the marshy corner of a field at Fen Lane, several miles away, where Richard lost his horse in a last desperate charging attempt to kill the future Henry VII, lost his crown and his helmet, and then lost his life to two savage blows to the base of his skull.

    After the cortege passes through, the tiny village has organised an entire day of events, centred on the village green and hall – which they decided last month was looking unacceptably shabby and within a fortnight, using local volunteers and donated materials, completely redecorated inside and out.

  <event start="2018-12-08T00:00:00Z" title="Saturday night, put">
    Dadlington usually divides its sympathies between the two sides, but the villagers have already packed the church on a Saturday night, put Richard on trial for the murder of his nephews, the Little Princes in the Tower, and found him not guilty: "you may leave without a stain on your character," Jacqui Morton, a former banker acting as judge for the night, assured him.

  <event start="2018-12-16T00:00:00Z" title="Sunday will only fly">
    The battlefield centre usually flies the standards of both Richard and Henry Tudor – "without wanting to appear like the Stanleys", Mackinder said, of Richard's former ally who lurked on the fringes of the battle until he saw which way the wind was blowing and then threw in his forces with the Tudors, "we usually have to sit on the fence a bit" – but on Sunday will only fly Richard's.
