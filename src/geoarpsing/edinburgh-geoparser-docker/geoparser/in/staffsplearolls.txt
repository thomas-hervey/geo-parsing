Staff. An assize, etc., if John de Aldenham and John his son, had unjustly diverted the course of a certain water in Covene, to the injury of the freehold of Roger, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, in Brewode. The Bishop by Adam le Arblaster, his attorney, stated that whereas a certain water called Covenebrok and another called Sarebrok, used to flow directly to his mill at Brewode, and by which mill and with which flow of water he used to grind day and night thirty quarters of each kind of corn; the defendants had lately diverted the course of the water of Sarebrok by a trench, so that the water now flowed direct to the mill of the said John de Aldenham in Covene, where it was so impeded and retained by the mill dam of the said mill, that the water no longer flowed to the mill of the Bishop, except at certain times, and at the will of the said John, and by which the Bishop's mill would no longer grind more than six quarters of each kind of corn working day and night. The defendants did not appear, but one William Jones answered for them as Bailiff, and denied that they had diverted the water of Sarebrok, or done any injury to the Bishop, and appealed to a jury. The jury found that the defendants had diverted the water and assessed the damages at 100s. It was therefore considered that the nuisance should be entirely removed and the course of the Sarebrok water restored to its ancient channel at the cost of the said John, and by the view of the recognitors of the assize. A postscript states that afterwards on the Vigil of St. Michael 16 E. III., the King sent to the said William de Shareshull, directing him to transmit the record and process of the said assize with everything relating to it, to be heard Coram Rege at the Quindene of St. Michael next following. m. 5.

Staff. An assize, etc., if Richard de Coven and Juliana, his wife, and John, son of the said Richard and Juliana, and William, son of Clement de Willenhale, had unjustly disseised Robert de la Lone, of Hampton, of a messuage in Wolvernehampton. Richard and Juliana answered as tenants, and conceded the assize. The Jury stated that the said William, son of Clement, was formerly seised of the tenement and gave it to the said Robert de la Lone, the plaintiff, and delivered seisin of it to him, on condition that he should grant it to the said William and to Petronilla the sister of the said Robert, to be held by them and the heirs of their bodies, and after the said Robert had obtained seisin of it, he refused to enfeoff the said William and Petronilla in it, and the said William had entered into it for that reason, and they prayed the instruction of the Justices; and the jury being asked if the said Robert held any other status in the messuage than as above described, answered in the negative. And as it appeared by the assize that the said Robert had no seisin of the messuage except conditionally, the suit was dismissed, and he is in misericordiÃ¢ for a false claim. m. 6.

Staff. An assize, etc., if Robert son of Ralph de Grendon, James de Stafford, Chivaler, Hugh de Meygnil, Chivaler, Osbert de Hynkeleye, John de Rocheford, Henry Danvers and Philip his son, and John le White, of Waverton, had unjustly disseised Roger de Chetwynd, Chivaler, and Joan, his wife, of the third part of the manor of Shenstone. The defendants did not appear, but one John le Grom answered for them as their Bailiff and prayed that the close writ might be read, and it appeared that in the clause "post primam transfretationem" the word "transfretationem" was written tnffr in place of t[a]nffr. The suit was therefore dismissed. (fn. 2) m. 6.

Staff. An assize, etc., if Robert son of Ralph de Grendon and the same defendants, had unjustly disseised Alice, formerly wife of Philip de Chetwynde Chivaler, if a third part of the manor of Shenstone. The defendants appeared as before by John le Grom, who took the same exception to the writ, and the suit was dismissed. m. 6.

Staff. An assize, etc., if Thomas de Wasteneys and Adam de Ruggele had unjustly disseised Roger, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, of ten acres of land in Ruggele. The defendants did not appear, but one Geoffrey Cok answered for them as their Bailiff, and the said Thomas answered as tenant, and stated that the land in question was soil covered with the river Trent, and that the course "filum" of that river, was the boundary between Ruggele and Colton, and that five acres of the land were in Colton and not in Ruggele, and he prayed judgment on the writ on that ground, and if it was given against him he stated that William de Wasteneys, his father, and whose heir he is, was seised of the said five acres and had died seised of them, and he had entered into them as his son and heir, and as regarded the other five acres, they were situated in Ruggele, and the vill of Ruggele was of ancient demesne of the King where no writ would run but the lesser writ of right, and he prayed judgment on that ground.

The Bishop stated that the manor of Ruggeleye was formerly in the seisin of King Richard, and at that time the land in question was part of the demesne lands of the manor and in the hands of the King and sueable at common law, and not of inferior tenure sueable only by writ of right, and the said King had given the manor to his predecessor, Hugh Nonaunt, to be held by him and his successors, and that the land was a free fee, and sueable at common law. The Jury stated that the ten acres of land in question were in Ruggeley, and not in Colton and were sueable at common law, and they found in favor of the Bishop and assessed his damages at 5 marks. m. 6, dorso.

Thomas de Venables and Emma appeared and the other defendants made default, and the assize was taken in their absence. Thomas and Emma denied any injury to the plaintiff, and appealed to a Jury, which found that all the defendants, except the said Emma, had unjustly disseised the plaintiff of the tenements in question and they assessed his damages at Â£10. Gilbert afterwards remitted his claim to damages. m. 4.
