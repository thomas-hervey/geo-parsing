^^o Dorset Fines. 



of I messuage, 4 carucates of land and lOos. of rent in Haselbere, ' 
Stocketurbervile and Crockerestoke and advowson of a moiety of the 
church of Haselbere. Plea of covenant was summoned, &amp;c. 

[The remaining portion of the last above written fine is exactly the 
same as the preceding. The first of the two deals with ** the advowson 
of the church," the second with the " advowson of a moiety of the 
church ". It may be that this second one was cancelled and the first 
dealing with "the advowson of the church," adopted. It is evident it 
came specially before the King from the unusual footnote ** Before the 
King in his Chancery ".]
