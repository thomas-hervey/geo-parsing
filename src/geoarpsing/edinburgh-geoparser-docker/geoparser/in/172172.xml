<p>Nadal and Murray set up semi showdown</p>
<p>(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray are both through to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup in Toronto, where they will face each other for a place in Sunday's final.</p>
<p>Murray played some superb tennis in crushing the in-form David Nalbandian but Nadal had to recover from dropping the opening set to get past Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber.</p>
<p>Nalbandian won the ATP title in Washington last weekend and came into Friday's encounter on an 11-match unbeaten streak.</p>
<p>But the fourth-seeded Briton, who has struggled to find his top form this season, brushed aside the Argentine in impressive fashion, securing a 6-2 6-2 victory in just 69 minutes.</p>
<p>"It was probably one of the best matches I've played this year," Murray told the official ATP Tour website.</p>
<p>"I served well and got the first good hits in a lot of the rallies, so I was able to dictate a lot of the points," added Murray -- who is the defending champion after winning the tournament in Montreal last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, top seed Nadal also secured his place in the last four, but he was not as impressive as Murray in a 3-6 6-3 6-4 victory over Kohlschreiber</p>
<p>In the evening session, third seed Federer will face a Wimbledon re-match with Czech Tomas Berdych, who beat him in the quarterfinals of the grasscourt tournament.</p>
<p>The winner of that match will face either second seed Novak Djokovic or Jeremy Chardy of France for a place in the final.</p>
