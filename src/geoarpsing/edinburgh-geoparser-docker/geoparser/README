To test the pipeline, do this:

cd scripts
cat ../in/172172.txt | ./run -t plain -g unlock

This uses the option of plain text input and uses unlock as the
gazetteer. The output xml file is sent to stdout.


VISUALISATION OUTPUT: -o
========================

To run and create visualisation files:

cat ../in/172172.txt | ./run -t plain -g unlock -o ../out 172172

Same as before except that -o takes two args, an output directory
(../out) and a prefix for the output file names (172172). The results
appear in the output directory (../out):

../out/172172.display.html  ../out/172172.geotagged.html
../out/172172.events.xml    ../out/172172.out.xml
../out/172172.gaz.xml       ../out/172172.nertagged.xml
../out/172172.gazlist.html  ../out/172172.timeline.html
../out/172172.gazmap.html   

172172.display.html is the geoparser map display.
172172.timeline.html is the timeline display (note that person, location, 
organisation and date entities are highlighted in this display). 
172172.out.xml is the output that goes to stdout when it is run
without -o.
The other files are ones used for the map and timeline display or ones
which may be useful in their own right.


SINGLE PLACENAME MARKERS: -top 
==============================

By default, all candidate placenames are shown in the display, with
the top-ranked one in green and the rest in red. If the -top option is
added to the command line then three extra display files will be
created, which show only the top-ranked candidate for each place, not
all the alternatives considered. For the example used above the extra
files would be:

../out/172172.display-top.html  ../out/172172.gazmap-top.html
../out/172172.gazlist-top.html

172172.gazlist-top.html is the geoparser map display with only one
placename marker per toponym.


INPUT TYPE AND GAZETTEER: -t -g
===============================

The options for type (-t) and gazetteer (-g) are:

    -t   plain          (plain text)
    	 ltgxml         (xml file in a certain format with paragraphs marked up)
	 gb             (Google Books html files)

    -g	 unlock         (Edina's gazetteer of mainly UK placenames)
    	 os             (Just the OS part of Unlock)
    	 naturalearth   (Just the Natural Earth part of Unlock)
    	 geonames       (online world-wide gazetteer)
	 plplus         (Pleiades+ gazetteer of ancient places, on Edina)
         deep           (DEEP gazetteer of historical placenames in England)

       [ geonames-local (locally maintained copy on of Geonames) ]
       [ plplus-local   (locally maintained Pleiades+, with geonames lookup) ]

The last two gazetteer options will only be usable if local gazetteers
are maintained; they are included in case useful. The full
documentation includes information on how to use them.

If your input is XML with paragraphs already marked, it may be worth converting
it to ltgxml format. See the example in/172172.xml for the format.

For Google Books input, which can be extremely untidy, pre-processing is done
to ensure it doesn't break the XML processes in the pipeline.


DOCDATE: -d
===========

If you know the creation/writing date of the document you can supply
this with -d:

cat ../in/172172.txt | ./run -t plain -g unlock -d 2010-08-13
cat ../in/172172.txt | ./run -t plain -g unlock -o ../out 172172 -d 2010-08-13 

cat ../in/richard111.txt | ./run -t plain -g unlock -o ../out richard111
cat ../in/richard111.txt | ./run -t plain -g unlock -o ../out richard111 -d 2015-03-18

This will be used in event and relation detection and timeline display.


LIMITING GEOGRAPHICAL AREA: -l -lb
==================================

If you know that toponyms in your text are likely to be in a particular 
geographical area you can specify a bounding circle locality (-l) or a
rectangular locality box (-lb). The geoparser will prefer places in the
area specified but will still choose locations outside it if other factors
give them higher weighting.

To specify a circular locality:

-l lat long radius score

where lat and long are in decimal degrees (ie 57.5 for 57 degrees 30 mins)
      radius is in km
      score is a numeric weight assigned to locations within the area (else 0).

To specify a locality box:

-lb W N E S score

where  W(est) N(orth) E(ast) S(outh) are decimal degrees
      score is as for -l option.


DEEP ONLY OPTIONS: -c -r
========================

For DEEP a new -c option has been added. This allows the user to
specify the county that the document is about in order to only
consider DEEP gaz entries for that county. Multiple uses of -c allow
several counties to be specified. For example:

cat <infile> | ./run -t plain -g deep -c Oxfordshire -c Wiltshire 

The values for -c are the county names in the DEEP gazetteer:

Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire,
Cumberland, Derbyshire, Devon, Dorset, Durham, East Riding of
Yorkshire, Essex, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire,
Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, North Riding of
Yorkshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Rutland,
Shropshire, Staffordshire, Surrey, Sussex, The Isle of Ely,
Warwickshire, West Riding of Yorkshire, Westmorland, Wiltshire,
Worcestershire.

Note that county names with white space need to be enclosed in double quotes:

cat <infile> | ./run -t plain -g deep -c Oxfordshire -c Wiltshire -c
"North Riding of Yorkshire" -c "East Riding of Yorkshire" -c "West
Riding of Yorkshire"

A new [-r begindate enddate ] option is also available for DEEP to
restrict the choice of DEEP gazetteer records which have attestation
dates withing the date range:

cat ../in/essexff.txt | ./run -t plain -g deep -c Essex -r 1000 1400
